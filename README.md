# async-winit-mit

some experimentation with rust async + winit

the idea is from [async-winit](https://github.com/notgull/async-winit) and [winit-async](https://github.com/Osspial/winit-async),
which have some problems:
- the former is AGPL licensed (btw i don't steal from gpl code, the only thing i used from that repo is the fact that "winit can be turned into an async runtime". i also peeked at the code, but nothing there was useful for me.)
- the latter is abandoned (yeah it have a PR from 2022 or sth), but more importantly, i want to make one myself for educational purposes + make changes as i want (yeah very autistic i know)

despite the suffix `mit` in the repo name, this is not licensed under the MIT license, but rather public domain because i'm lazy to copy a license file xddddddd.
